    <p>
      Now exporting an image is not explaned well.  You should RENDER your animation before trying to export it.  Now it looks
      Stupid when you try with out animating your work before exporting.  It's really kind of simple but it took me about 2
      hours looking in the depths of hell[1] but adventualy I got it.  After that I made a video showing what I did to help
      you.
