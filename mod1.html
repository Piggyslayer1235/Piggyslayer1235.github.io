    <h1>Cups in blender</h1>
    <p>
      So you want to know what I did in Blender?  Well I will tell/show you.  
      I first made a cup and rendered it in Blender.  Now this was my first 3d moudel.  
      I'm joking my first moudel was a stick...I think?  It looked like a stick.
      Any way here is what I created!

    <p>
      So I dont have a video to show you.  Because if I did the whole process of doing it.  
      Then I would've had the video be about Twenty to maybe thrity minutes long.  
      But I had some trouble the first time.  Which is what I am showing/telling you.  
      I didnt have a mouse to work with at the time.  But I did the best I could.
      A few times I made a mistake.  Like miss-clicking or making a small clipping error.  
      But in the end I was Happy with what I made.  :3  I will see you in the next moudel.
